                                                        Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Cristian Delvalle <br/>
                                                                  Welcome!!  <br/>
 <p> I am a 26 years old Argentinian who loves technology and problemsolving, currently focused on full stack web development with MERN stack, systems, AGILE methodologies,
digital transformation and learning new technologies. Recently, this year, my passion for programming was rediscovered, so I decided to get myself a full stack web develper certification from the Henry Bootcamp.
And after hours of tears, frustration and lots and lots of effort I got it, so here am I wanting to share with you my skills and future projects. <p/><br/>

ðŸ“„ About me:
  I'm a Fullstack Web Developer graduated from Henry, an intensive bootcamp in Argentina. After years working as a deliveryman I decided to shake things up a little.
  Currently looking forward to joining a team where I could keep on learning at a nice pace, I am a very curious, passionate person and I really enjoy teamwork, pair-programming, even more when I get a review of my work, making mistakes is the best way to learn.
I am attracted to new challenges
